      <p><strong>This is a personality quiz I created during the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program. It tells you whether you are more like the Disney princess Mulan or Moana based on which activities you would rather do during a day. I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>This is a game I created using Java called Puzzlefun! It is a game directed towards children ages 3-6 and has four different puzzles that children can choose from. Above is a screenshot of how the game looks. The other options were a butterfly, cat, and car. </strong>

      <p><strong>This is an RPG game I created using Java where the elements of Earth are coming together to defeat their enemy pollution. In my game, I coded a character selection screen (see above), a screen talking of the problem and goal of my game, the actual game itself (see above), a win screen, and a lose screen. All graphics are my creations. </strong></p>
