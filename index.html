      <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
     <div id="left">
                  <h3 > Hi! My name is Zaara. I am 17 years old and a rising senior in high school. I live in Houston, Texas. I enjoy travelling to different places, reading books, learning to play the piano, and most importantly... Coding! I have been coding since the age of 14 and find it very fascinating. I even find myself playing with the "Inspect" tool on <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>. I am most skilled in Java and have done multiple projects. Two of them can be found in the Portfolio section of this website. </h3>
